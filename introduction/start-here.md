**Welcome!** This documentation later referred to as Docs will help you develop "true" Web3 communication dApps (i.e. decentralized applications) and help you learn how to use them. Here you will find concepts, how-to guides, quickstarts, tutorials, API & SDK references, code examples, release notes, and more.

### Context

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Problem:** There is no denying that current email, messaging, and data transfer models are broken. We lose ownership of data the moment we attach it to an email or drop it in any cloud service, as we expose our communication content and metadata the moment we use any ”free” email, chat, or data transfer services available today. It goes without saying; **if you are not paying for the product, you are the product**. This “new normal” where users' data is mined and exploited is not viable. The time for an alternative is long overdue.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Solution:** Blockchain on-chain communication can change the narrative of traditional digital communication and data management from; custodial to self-custodial; centralized to decentralized; permissioned to permissionless, and; from **“free” but mined to payable but yours**.
{% endhint %}

### What is Immu3?

Immu3 is the ultimate Web3-Infra stack for building and utilizing on-chain communication applications. The complete developer platform for pioneering the future of global on-chain communication with low-code tooling and configurability developer needs to accelerate from idea to launch. Built on top of the Block Labs \[4thTech] OCC (i.e. on-chain communication) technology framework and CR Systems \[PollinationX] decentralized storage infra, the Immu3 in essence acts as the integrator focusing on the abstraction, adoption and commercialisation of this new technology.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Core primitives;**

💡 1 blockchain mail/message/data-sharing = 1 L1/L2/L3 transaction \
💡 not your keys = not your mail/message/data
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Apps built with the Immu3 infra-stack are based on decentralized principles;**

(1) pseudonymous login via Web3 wallets;\
(2) self-custodial and immutable;\
(3) on-chain verifiable;\
(4) communication data is accessible only to the private key owner; \
(5) end-to-end (i.e. E2E) communication encryption enabled by self-custodial [Encryptor extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/encryptor/feolajpinjjfikmmeknkdjbllbppojij?hl=en-GB\&authuser=3);\
(6) encrypted attachments and big data files are stored on decentralized storage via [PX](../integrators/architecture-by-layers/pollinationx-decentralized-storage-infra.md) service;\
(7) no personal data whatsoever is collected, and; \
(8) open-source.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:** None of the protocols from the native Immu3 ecosystem would ever ask for your seed passphrase!&#x20;

### Products

* [**Integrator Dashboard**](https://wiki.immu3.io/integrators/clients/intro-to-integrator-dashboard)**:** Unlocks the skill and know-how required to abstract the complexities and simplify the deployment of on-chain communication apps while reducing deployment time from the duration of months to under an hour.
* [**End-user App Suite**](https://wiki.immu3.io/end-users/end-users-app-suite)**:** Offers a self-custodial Web3 alternative to traditional email, messaging, and data-sharing platforms.&#x20;
* [**AppChain**](https://wiki.immu3.io/immu3-appchain/intro-to-appchain)**:** Delivers a smart contract EVM AppChain with reliability, scalability and security needed within use cases of on-chain communication.
* [**Multi-chain**](https://wiki.immu3.io/integrators/multi-chain)**:** Creates multi-chain protocol instances and enables ready-to-use compatibility with multiple EVM chains.

### Associated Fees

Web3 mainly works on the PAYGO (i.e. pay-as-you-go) model, meaning the user has to pay for every transaction, ergo pay for every mail, message, or data transfer. To make on-chain communication more viable, development is being done that will in parallel to PAYGO also enable subscription-based models, so the users will be able to pay a monthly subscription fee to access block space and communicate without the hurdle of paying for every transaction. For a deeper look jump to the [Fees](../integrators/fees-and-integrator-economics.md) chapter.
