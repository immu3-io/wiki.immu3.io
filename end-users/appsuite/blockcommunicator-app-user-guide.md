### Wallet Setup, App Connection and Blockchain Choice

BlockCommunicator is a Web3-native application supporting [MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-metamask/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-crypto-wallet), and Wallet Connect. We recommend beginners take the [MetaMask Web3 101](https://learn.metamask.io/overview) course before starting.

Since BlockCommunicator app services run on-chain, ensure your wallet has enough gas for setup and operations. Currently, we support Fantom Opera, requiring FTM gas tokens.&#x20;

BlockCommunicator app is a multi-chain application. Users can choose between several supported EVM blockchains. We recommend browsing the [supported network list](https://wiki.immu3.io/integrators/multi-chain) and choosing the blockchain most suited to your needs.

Steps:

* ‚öôÔ∏è Install and login to a supported wallet
* üí∞ Fund your wallet with gas
* ü§ù Connect your wallet with the [BlockCommunicator](https://app.blockcommunicator.com) App (app.blockcommunicator.com)
* üîó Select blockchain

### Dashboard Setup <a href="#dashboard-setup" id="dashboard-setup"></a>

The BlockCommunicator app dashboard is your mission control within the application. It lets you set up self-custodial communication encryption via the Encryptor extension and manage decentralized storage with PX Storage NFTs.

The Encryptor extension adds an encryption layer for blockchain-based mail and messages. A one-time on-chain transaction, requiring gas, saves the sender/recipient's public key.

Decentralized storage and bandwidth are used in communication. PX Storage NFTs, which can be minted as needed, enable self-custodial storage management. Bandwidth usage depends on the number of uploads to decentralized storage.

Steps:

* ‚öôÔ∏è Download and install the [Encryptor extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/encryptor/feolajpinjjfikmmeknkdjbllbppojij?authuser=3\&hl=en-GB) from the Google Chrome Store
* üîß Set your Encryptor password and save your seed words
* ‚õìÔ∏è "**Register Encryptor**" and confirm the transaction with your wallet
* üëå "**Connect**" your PX Storage NFT and confirm the transaction with your wallet
* ‚õèÔ∏è "**Mint**" your 100MB Free PX Storage NFT confirm the transaction with your wallet

### Sending and receiving on-chain mails <a href="#how-to-send-data-files-using-polygon-or-arbitrum-mainnets-1" id="how-to-send-data-files-using-polygon-or-arbitrum-mainnets-1"></a>

The BlockCommunicator app empowers you to send and receive end-to-end encrypted BlockMails, protecting against data mining, phishing, spoofing, spam, and identity theft. The sender and receiver must be on the same blockchain, as cross-chain emailing is not supported. While encryption is optional, we strongly encourage its use. On-chain communication incurs various [fees](https://wiki.immu3.io/builders/fees-and-integrator-economics) throughout the process.
