# Intro to AppChain

### Let's Start

Immu3 AppChain is built on the Tansii AppChain infrastructure protocol. It inherits block finality (consensus) from Polkadot RelayChain. Consequently, it acts as a Layer 1 blockchain like Moonbeam, not Layer 2 solutions on top of another Layer 1. It is a public EVM smart contract platform that offers reliability, scalability and security needed within use cases of on-chain communication.&#x20;

**Explainer:** Built on the Rust-based Substrate framework, [Tanssi](https://www.tanssi.network/) offers high performance, flexibility, and rapid deployment via its library of pre-built pallets. Substrate's modular structure eases appchain creation and deployment.

### Baseline EVM (i.e. Ethereum Virtual Machine) Template <a href="#baseline-evm-template" id="baseline-evm-template"></a>

Extending the _Baseline AppChain template_, this template provides not only Immu3 AppChain support but also an EVM and full Ethereum compatibility. It enables an Ethereum compatibility layer for Immu3 ContainerChain to allow running unmodified Ethereum dApps while using tools and infrastructure like MetaMask out of the box.

### Features

* Transaction execution reliability
* Robust security and decentralisation inherited from Polkadot RelayChain
* Congestion resistant
* On-chain communication-specific
* Native apps: BlockCommunicator, W3XShare, PX Storage NFTs and PX Drive
