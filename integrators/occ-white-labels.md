# OCC White-labels

### Let's Start

White-label frameworks enable fast and easy builds. To begin, we recommend looking at wiki Guides and GitHub repos which include runnable examples and walkthroughs of core usages. These guides will help you better understand how to use the white-label framework. To test drive white labels in production connect to the [4P Email & Chat Super App](https://app.the4thpillar.io/). As a part of the immu3's infrastructure integrator stack, there are several white-label dApp frameworks available;&#x20;

* BlockMail & BlockChat: [Wiki](https://wiki.4thtech.io/docs/integration/white-label), [GitHub](https://github.com/4thtech/white-label-client)
* Data file sharing: [Wiki](https://wiki.w3xshare.com/architecture/w3xshare-platform/white-label), [GitHub](https://github.com/immu3-io/w3xshare-white-label)

**Tip:** The Integrator Dashboard will enable one-click white-label deploys. It will unlock the skill and know-how required to abstract the complexities and simplify the deployment of on-chain communication apps.
