# ElizaOS

ElizaOS-based plugins enable devs to give AI agents additional powers of permissionless on-chain communication and data storage ownership:

* ElizaOS plugin that enables AI agents to seamlessly integrate on-chain communication capabilities, allowing permissionless P2P messaging and secure interaction.
* ElizaOS plugin that empowers AI agents to mint their decentralized storage NFTs, granting them ownership of storage units (e.g., 1GB, 5GB, 10GB) and enabling self-sovereign data management.
