# Intro to Decentralized Storage Drive

### True Self-custodial Data Management

PX Drive is a decentralized storage-based app that enables users to store and access files online in a true self-custodial and permissionless way. The service syncs stored documents, photos and other types of data files across all the user's devices, that support Web3 wallets.

### **Features**

* Pseudonymous communication via Web3 login
* Multi-chain wallet interoperability via MetaMask or Wallet Connect
* Robust and resistant to Web2 data mining, data ownership loss & phishing
* Self-custodial and immutable
* Data access is possible only with users' private key
* Multiple accounts possibility
* Self-client custody (e.g. in the case of dApp downtime, the open-source UI client is available)
* Multi-chain
* Storage unit based on [PX NFTs](https://wiki.pollinationx.io/overview/px-storage-nft).

{% hint style="success" %}
**Explainer:** PX Drive uses PollinationX storage NFTs to enable data file storage over decentralized storage networks. Every user is eligible for the first `100MB` storage NFT. To increase data storage capacity an additional storage NFT needs to be added to the wallet. Users can mint PollinationX decentralized storage NFTs according to their needs (e.g. 5GB, 20GB, 100GB). Storage is available until used.
